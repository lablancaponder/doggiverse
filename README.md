Doggiverse is a social network applications for dog owners to meet each other.  Currently, the app offers profiles for

### Future Add ons

* The ability to upload images. Currently the only image(s) allowed are through Gravatar when signing up with a valid
email. This image is used for the profile only.

* Custom design.  Bootstrap was utilized for the front-end but would like to implement a custom design and css.

* Liking/Unliking posts will refresh the entire page.  Would like only the post to refresh.

* Add more social aspects like sharing, befriending and messaging.
